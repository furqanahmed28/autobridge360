AutoBridge360 – Prototype Requirements Document
1. Purpose of This Document
This document defines what is required in the AutoBridge360 prototype based on the approved business plan. The prototype is not a full product, but a proof-of-capability system designed to:
•	Demonstrate the core value proposition to investors, regulators, and early partners
•	Validate technical feasibility of key innovations
•	Support UK Innovator / Founder visa and funding discussions
•	Enable early pilot discussions with importers, exporters, and garages
________________________________________
2. Prototype Objectives (What the Prototype Must Prove)
The prototype must clearly demonstrate:
1.	End-to-end vehicle lifecycle continuity (import → compliance → ownership)
2.	AI-driven automation replacing manual workflows
3.	Trust, provenance, and risk visibility unavailable in existing tools
4.	Clear differentiation vs. point solutions (VIN checks, spreadsheets, portals)
The prototype does not need full-scale automation or live regulatory integrations.

3. Scope Definition
3.1 Included in Prototype
•	Limited number of vehicles (demo + pilot data)
•	Simulated or semi-manual integrations where required
•	Core workflows for one primary market (UK)
•	Web-based dashboards (desktop-first)
3.2 Explicitly Out of Scope (for Prototype)
•	Full DVLA live integration
•	Real payment processing
•	Large-scale marketplace liquidity
•	Full mobile apps (responsive web acceptable)
•	Multi-country regulatory coverage
________________________________________
4. User Roles Required in Prototype
The prototype must support role-based access for the following personas:
1.	Importer (Primary User)
2.	Exporter (Japanese-side user)
3.	Vehicle Owner (Post-import)
4.	Garage Partner (After-sales)
5.	Admin / Platform Operator
Each role should see only relevant data and actions.

5. Core Prototype Modules & Requirements
5.1 Vehicle Identity & Provenance Core (Mandatory)
Objective
Demonstrate the End-to-End Vehicle Provenance Graph™ concept.
Functional Requirements
•	Unique vehicle profile created using:
o	Chassis number
o	Engine number (optional)
o	Auction reference
•	Timeline-based lifecycle view with events:
o	Auction listing
o	Export documentation
o	Shipment
o	UK arrival
o	Registration status
o	Service events
Output
•	Visual timeline or graph-style view
•	Immutable event history (edit tracked)
•	Document-linked events
________________________________________
5.2 AI Document Processing (Prototype-Level)
Objective
Prove reduction of manual data entry and translation errors.
Functional Requirements
•	Upload of sample documents:
o	Export Certificate (Japanese)
o	Auction Sheet
o	Invoice / Bill of Lading
•	OCR extraction of:
o	Chassis number
o	Mileage
o	Auction grade
o	Exporter name
•	Auto-mapped structured fields
•	Confidence score per extracted field
Acceptable for Prototype
•	Pre-trained OCR or third-party OCR API
•	Manual correction UI
________________________________________
5.3 Compliance Engine (UK – Rules-Based)
Objective
Show pre-emptive compliance validation before port arrival.
Functional Requirements
•	Rule checks for:
o	Vehicle age
o	Document completeness
o	Chassis consistency across documents
•	Pass / fail status per vehicle
•	Human-readable compliance feedback
Prototype Notes
•	Rules can be hard-coded or config-based
•	No live customs submission required
________________________________________
5.4 Shipment & Port Visibility (Simulated)
Objective
Show single-pane visibility instead of emails and spreadsheets.
Functional Requirements
•	Shipment timeline with statuses:
o	Booked
o	In transit
o	Arrived
o	Cleared
•	Estimated arrival date (static or mock ML)
•	Shared visibility for importer & exporter
________________________________________
5.5 Importer Dashboard (Critical)
Required Views
•	Vehicle list with status badges
•	Compliance alerts
•	Document completeness indicator
•	Risk score snapshot
Key Actions
•	Upload documents
•	View compliance issues
•	Track shipment
________________________________________
5.6 Adaptive Multi-Sided Risk Score (AMRS – Prototype)
Objective
Demonstrate risk unification, not accuracy.
Functional Requirements
•	Single risk score per vehicle (0–100)
•	Breakdown into:
o	Compliance risk
o	Document integrity risk
o	Mileage anomaly risk
•	Different views:
o	Importer view (operational)
o	Insurer view (simplified)
Prototype Implementation
•	Rule-weighted scoring acceptable

5.7 Ownership Handover & Digital Vehicle Wallet
Objective
Prove lifecycle continuity after import.
Functional Requirements
•	Transfer vehicle to "Owner" role
•	Owner dashboard showing:
o	Import history
o	Documents
o	Service recommendations
________________________________________
5.8 Predictive Maintenance (Lightweight)
Objective
Show import-linked intelligence continues post-sale.
Functional Requirements
•	Rule-based service recommendation
•	Example alerts:
o	First service window
o	Battery check suggestion
•	Ability to log completed service
________________________________________
5.9 Garage Interface (Basic)
Functional Requirements
•	View assigned vehicles
•	Log service event
•	Upload service document
•	Event added to provenance timeline
________________________________________
6. Non-Functional Requirements
6.1 Security & Trust
•	Role-based access control
•	Audit trail for document changes
•	Timestamped events
6.2 UX Expectations
•	Clean, professional B2B interface
•	Timeline-based storytelling of vehicle history
•	Clear differentiation from spreadsheets & portals
6.3 Performance
•	Fast document upload
